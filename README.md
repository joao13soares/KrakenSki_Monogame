Kraken Ski game made in Monogame, as a project for the Game Development Techniques university course.

The goal of this project was to implement a 2D non-tiled game.
I decided to implement a Water Ski game where the enemies are Krakens.

Game Goals:
- Survive each level until the 100 points are reached;
- Defeat the Kraken boss on the 4th level;

Game Mechanics:
- The Player is damaged by colliding with the Krakens or with the ink shots thrown by the Kraken boss;
- The Krakens can be damaged by throwing trash bags at them;
- The moving velocity of the Krakens increases with each level;
- The trash bags can be obtained after collecting trash from the ocean (the quantity of collected trash increases with each level);
